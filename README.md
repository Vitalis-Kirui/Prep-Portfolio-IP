# Description
When you are in the page, first you will a nav which at the moment doesnt'n lead you to any other page because its a single page. But when you are in My projects section, I placed some buttons which can lead you to where you can find the projects themselve on github.
Everything as is what you can read except for the part for contact me. This is where one enters his/her email, number and the message. On the message section, one has to indicate whether he/she is reaching out for hire or leaving a review.
Finally on the footer, It has my contact details like email, phone number and whatsapp number to the left. On the right are links to my social media platforms, incase someone wants to follow me.
